## Model Details
The system implements two classification models:
1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - Polynomial kernel
   - Optimized hyperparameters
   - Suitable for complex image classification

2. **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)**
   - 100 estimators
   - Enhanced accuracy and robustness
   - Better handling of overfitting

## Performance Metrics
The system provides comprehensive performance analysis including:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Comparative Analysis Graphs

## Database Configuration
The application uses MySQL for user management:
- Host: localhost
- Default Username: root
- Default Password: root
- Database Name: sparse_db

## Security Features
- Secure user authentication
